        The new coronavirus is officially called SARS-CoV-2, which stands for
        severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. An infection with this
        virus can lead to coronavirus disease 19, or{" "}

          COVID-19.

      </p>
      <p>
        SARS-CoV-2 is related to the coronavirus SARS-CoV, which caused another
        kind of coronavirus disease in 2002 to 2003. However, from what we know
        so far, SARS-CoV-2 is different from other viruses, including other
        coronaviruses. The evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted
        more easily and cause life-threatening illness in some people. Like
        other coronaviruses, it can survive in the air and on{" "}

          surfaces{" "}
        </a>{" "}
        long enough for someone to contract it. It’s possible that you could
        acquire SARS-CoV-2 if you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching
        a surface or object that has the virus on it. However, this is

        to be the main way that the virus spreads However, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies
        faster in the body even when you don’t have symptoms. Additionally, you
        can transmit the virus even if you never get symptoms at all. Some
        people have mild to moderate symptoms only, while others have severe
        COVID-19 symptoms. Here are the medical facts to help us understand how
        to best protect ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <h2>Tips for prevention:</h2>
      <p>
        Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from contracting and
        transmitting SARS-CoV-2.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
      <p>
        Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work
        the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your
        fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use
        hand sanitizer when you cannot
        <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/washing-hands#how-to">
          {" "}
          wash your hands
        </a>{" "}
        wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day,
        especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Avoid touching your face</h3>
      <p>
        SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the
        virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>gas pump handle</li>
        <li>your cell phone</li>
        <li>a doorknob</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth,
        nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give
        SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
      <p>
        Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can
        transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Don’t share personal items</h3>
      <p>Do not share personal items like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>phones</li>
        <li>makeup</li>
        <li>combs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach
        children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for
        their own use only.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h3>
      <p>
        SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it
        can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze,
        or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3
        days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as
        possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough,
        regardless.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Clean and disinfect surfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home
        like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>countertops</li>
        <li>door handles</li>
        <li>furniture</li>
        <li>toys</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also,{" "}

          clean your phone{" "}
        </a>
        , laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.
        Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home.
        Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in
        between disinfecting surfaces.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts
        in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.
        Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working
        remotely when possible. If you must go out for necessities, keep a
        distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus
        by speaking to someone in close contact to you.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Do not gather in groups</h3>
      <p>
        Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in
        close contact with someone. This includes avoiding all religious places
        of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another
        congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h3>
      <p>
        Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants,
        coffee shops, bars, and other eateries. The virus can be transmitted
        through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be temporarily
        airborne from other people in the venue. You can still get delivery or
        takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be
        reheated. High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to one recent,
        not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill coronaviruses. This means
        it may be best to avoid cold foods from restaurants and all food from
        buffets and open salad bars.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Wash fresh groceries</h3>
      <p>
        Wash all produce under running water before eating or preparing. The{" "}

        things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and

      <h3>11. Self-quarantine if sick</h3>

        . Stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or
        eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If you need urgent
        medical care, wear a mask and let them know you may have COVID-19.
